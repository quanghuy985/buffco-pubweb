CKFinderJcrop
=============

CKFinder plugin of a much needed image cropping feature using the JQuery based JCrop (http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html).

This is an alpha version and works fine, I just need to iron out a few issues and tidy it up.

To install the plugin
 1. Create folder "cropresize" inside CKfinder/plugins
 2. Export the code inside this folder
 3. Edit CKfinder/config.php and at the end of the file add line 

>    include_once "plugins/cropresize/plugin.php";
